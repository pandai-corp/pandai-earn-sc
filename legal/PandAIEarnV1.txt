You agree and acknowledge that you are exposed to the possibility that PandAI may become unable to repay its obligations to you in part or in full, in which case any Digital Assets may be at risk of partial or total loss.

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use of Digital Assets. Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, including rollback attacks or Blockchain reorganizations.

Although PandAI takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber threats, circumstances may arise where losses or damages are incurred.
In light of these risks, which are only some of the risks involved in using the Services and do not constitute an exhaustive list of such risks, you should carefully consider whether Digital Assets in general and/or using our Services is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.

9. SETTLEMENT ANDREWARDS OF PANDAI EARN
Subject to these Terms, for any of your Eligible Digital Assets that you utilize in the Earn Service (if available to you), you have a call option on all loans made to PandAI to demand repayment of any loan at any time to your Virtual Wallet. Such payment will terminate in whole your loan to PandAI and you shall no longer accrue Rewards on the amount of loans as of the time of your exercise of the call option. If you exercise call option of all loans or partial loan to PandAI and demand repyment of any loan at any time to your Virtual Wallet, PandAI reserves the right to exercise the settlement within 14 days of such demand by you or upon expiration of Lockup period. PandAI initiates the settlement process immediately following expiration of Lockup period when possible in the consideration of the paragraph above. Everyone can entrust his assets to PandAI Earn, but when claiming the reward, there's a claim fee ≤10 % paid in PandAI Token that's being burned.
PandAI Earn is a product that introduces the PandAI Token burn mechanism to support token price and bring value to the whole PandAI ecosystem.

For PandAI Earn Rewards based on Lockup periods and claim fee see table below: 
There are several Tiers of PandAI Earn based on the value of assets being deposited, with minimum deposit of $100 and parameters defined in contract constructor.

Let's demonstrate Tier parameters on two examples
Example1: Client deposits d = $2,000 (it's his first deposit). 
He's in Tier 3, with Monthly Gain = 1.5 %. User returns in t = 3 months to claim his Clients Reward, which is (no compound interest)
There's 8 % Claim Fee in Tier 3 which means Client must pay 0.08 * 90 = $7.2 in PandAI Token when claiming the reward (those PandAI Tokens are being burned).

Example2: User deposits d = $10,000 (it's his first deposit). 
He's in Tier 5, with Monthly Gain = 2.2 %. User returns in t = 3 months to claim his Clients Reward, which is (compound interest)
There's 5 % Claim Fee in Tier 5 which means Client must pay 0.05 * 682.27 = $34.11 in PandAI Token when claiming the reward (those PandAI Tokens are being burned). 

IT IS POSSIBLE TO WITHDRAWING DEPOSIT BEFORE LOCKUP, BUT THIS COMES WITH ADDITIONAL WITHDRAW FEE PAID IN PANDAI TOKEN. IN CASE DEPOSIT IS WITHDRAWN AFTER LOCKUP, THERE IS NO WITHDRAW FEE APPLIED.

Withdrawal limits for Rewards on amounts Greater then 1000 USDT may apply, based on legal, regulatory and AML considerations. Our policies and procedures may require additional compliance checks that require additional time to complete. Any individual request to exceed withdrawal limits set by PandAI must be sent via email to info@pandai.com. 
Every transaction request shall be deemed pending until accepted by us. We may refuse to accept such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to inaccurate or misleading information provided by you, or any doubt or suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation, a sanctioned transaction, money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crime related to your Assets used for PandAI Earn services.
PandAI and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of transactions either temporarily or permanently. Provided that PandAI has taken reasonable commercial and operational measures to prevent such events in technical systems controlled by PandAI, PandAI is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transactions.

5. Rewards
5.1 PandAI will transfer Rewards to your cryptocurrency wallet with a set percentage of fees on the transactions earned from the Clients using PandAI Earn services with your Referral Code. For clarity, those fees are the amounts actually collected from the Clients using services.
5.2 There are two types of rewards in PandAI Earn
- User Rewards derived from user's own deposit (defined in PandAI Earn Terms of use) and
- Referral Rewards.
Referral Rewards are derived from sum of deposited assets of users that joined PandAI Earn following given Referral Link, generates Monthly Gain g = 0.2% and comes with claim fee of 10%.
Let's demonstrate how Referral Reward is calculated on one example.

Example: Users that followed given Referral Link has deposited total D = $100,000. User that created the Referral Link returns in t = 3 months to claim his Referral Reward r, which is
r = D * g * t = 100000 * 0.002 * 3 = $600
There's 10% Claim Fee so the user must pay 0.1 * 600 = $60 in PandAI Token when claiming the referral reward (those PandAI Tokens are being burned).
